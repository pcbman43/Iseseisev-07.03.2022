# Todo App - Test Plan

The Todo App was created as an exercise to get to know testing a bit more. More precisely automated UI testing is explored.

## 1. What is going to be tested?

The application only uses React.js in the front end with no back-end interface. Only the UI is going to be tested. Tests should cover the application requirements mentioned in app-requirements.md file.

In addition to the UI tests based on the application requirements, exploratory tests can be created to try to find issues that might not have been covered by the requirements. This is not mandatory though.

## 2. Test documentation and schedule

### 2.1 Documentation

The only test documentation will be this master Test Plan and bug reports with found issues. Test cases and design will be defined in the cypress folder in test files.

### 2.2 Schedule

Tests will be run while code is being further developed and before a new release is made.

## 3. Testing methodology

UI tests are going to be carried out using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).
